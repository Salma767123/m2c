/**
 * Shared logo component for every surface that displays the company brand —
 * Header, Footer, login pages, vendor/checker headers, etc.
 *
 * What it does
 *   - Fetches the admin-uploaded company logo from the public company-info
 *     endpoint exactly once per page session (module-level promise cache —
 *     so a Header + Footer mounted together don't both hit the API).
 *   - While the fetch is in flight, renders a neutral pulsing skeleton in
 *     the same layout box the final logo will occupy. No flash of the
 *     static fallback logo before the dynamic one resolves, which used to
 *     confuse users who'd briefly see the bundled M2C placeholder and
 *     then watch it swap to whatever the admin had uploaded.
 *   - When the fetch resolves with a logo URL → renders an <img> with the
 *     dynamic URL.
 *   - When the fetch resolves WITHOUT a URL (or errors out) → renders the
 *     bundled fallback as a Next.js <Image> with width/height/sizes/priority
 *     wired through.
 *
 * Why a module-level cache and not React Query / Context
 *   This is a single string fetched on first paint and cached for the
 *   entire session. There is no invalidation story and no per-component
 *   variation. A 30-line module cache is the right size for the problem,
 *   and avoids pulling in a heavier client-state dependency.
