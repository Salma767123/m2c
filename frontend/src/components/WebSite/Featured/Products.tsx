/**
 * Featured Products.
 *
 * Three things were wrong with the previous version and all three are fixed
 * here, without touching any service call.
 *
 *  1. Dead space. Cards were a fixed width (xl:w-64 = 256px) inside a
 *     max-w-420 (1680px) container, so 4 cards + 3 gaps came to 1120px and
 *     left ~496px of empty row — roughly a third of the section. They are now
 *     grid columns, so they stretch to whatever width is available.
 *
 *  2. Layout snap on load. The old skeleton used `grid xl:grid-cols-4`, which
 *     DOES stretch, so cards were ~380px while loading and snapped to 256px
 *     the moment the fetch resolved. The skeleton below now mirrors the loaded
 *     grid exactly — same columns, same gaps, same image ratio.
 *
 *  3. No entrance. The section used <Reveal>, which carries a 1.4s fail-safe
 *     that fires on a timer regardless of scroll position — so by the time you
 *     scrolled here it had already revealed and nothing animated.
 *
 * The entrance: each card starts under a panel of cloth with a rolled edge at
 * its top. The roll travels top-to-bottom and the cloth follows it off the
 * card, uncovering the product — a bolt of fabric unrolled onto a table.
 * Cards stagger so it reads left-to-right as a wave, the same language as the
 * hero's weave transition.
 *
 * The header is deliberately quieter than Top Selling / Best Sellers below it:
 * eyebrow, a hairline running the width of the row, and a text link whose rule
 * draws itself on hover — instead of a third identical red pill button. The
 * dot-grid SectionBackdrop was dropped here for the same reason; it was one of
 * the main things making all three product sections look like one section
 * printed three times.

/**
 * ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER PRODUCTS — REMOVE BEFORE LAUNCH ⚠️
 *
 * The featured endpoint currently returns four products, and the row is built
 * for six. These two pad it out so the layout can be reviewed full.
 *
 * They are NOT real. Both fail the moment anyone interacts with them:
 *  · clicking either card routes to /products/<slug>, which does not exist → 404
 *  · Add to Cart posts an id the backend has never seen → error toast
 *
 * The proper fix is to flag two more products as featured in the admin, which
 * takes seconds and needs no code. When that happens, delete this constant and
 * the `padded` line below it — nothing else refers to them.
 *
 * The photographs are real, at least: both already ship in the repo under
 * assets/images/features/products, and both are shot on light backgrounds so
 * they sit correctly beside the four coming from the API.
