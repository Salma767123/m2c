 * It was `from-gray-900 to-gray-800`: #111827 to #1f2937, a cool blue-black
 * belonging to no palette on this site, meeting the maroon footer edge to
 * edge with nothing between them.
 *
 * Light maroon instead. Not a new colour - it is brand red pulled right down,
 * already carrying the homepage's Best Seller row and the DownloadApp QR
 * card. Kept identical to BestSeller.tsx so the two stay in step: if that one
 * is ever retuned, this is the same edit twice, not a fresh guess.
 *
 * Contrast on the darkest step (#f7e5e0), measured there and re-checked here:
 * body text #5f5550 is 5.94:1, the 11px eyebrow #c41617 is 4.96:1.

          weekly schedule. That was the wrong idea for this business — M2C has
          no shopfront and support does not keep counter hours — so the panel,
          and every piece of clock machinery behind it (a fixed-timezone Intl
          formatter, a minute-aligned timer, a hydration-safe external store),
          came out. None of it is worth keeping for a company that is reachable
          all week.

          Centred rather than a two-column split, because with the panel gone
          there is no second column: text pinned left with nothing on the right
          is the stranded-object problem this page already had once. */}
