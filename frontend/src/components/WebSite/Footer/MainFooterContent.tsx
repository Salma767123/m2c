 *
 * Removed earlier, and still gone:
 *  · the "— OUR PROMISE —" headline block, which repeated the eyebrow and the
 *    layout of the section directly above it, and opened the footer with a
 *    42px hero headline;
 *  · its subtitle, which was the same sentence as the company column's
 *    description 150px below it;
 *  · the four trust badges, which were the third set on one page after
 *    PromoStrip's — and which carried "Pan-India shipping" on a store that
 *    runs NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_REGION=US and prices in dollars;
 *  · the grid, dot, twin-radial and drifting-contour layers — four decorative
 *    passes behind the content;
 *  · the "Stay Updated" newsletter column. Beyond taking three of the twelve
 *    columns, its submit handler showed a "Subscribed" toast and then discarded
 *    the address — there is no subscribe endpoint in the backend. It had been
 *    collecting nothing while telling people otherwise.
